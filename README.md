## Contribution
The information in the [data](https://github.com/var-greyShader/pokedex/tree/master/src/data) folder is incomplete. The information was scraped from [pokedex.org](https://pokedex.org/) which has information of 649 Pokémons and I used a publicly available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) which has 807 Pokémons, so every information of POkémons after #649 is repeated. You can contribute by updating those details.
